The annotation task that we are considering is labeling recipes with skill levels. Each recipe will be rated as one of the following levels: novice, intermediate, or expert. In order to assign each recipe to a level, we will consider factors such as the number of ingredients, the types of techniques used, total preparation time, as well as the likelihood of a mistake. These are only preliminary guidelines to what will be considered when assigning labels, as there are likely other factors that affect the difficulty level of a recipe. 

We are sourcing our data from Kaggle. The link to the original dataset is attached here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/recipenlg?resource=download

The license of the dataset states that it is available for use under non-commercial purposes, meaning that it is not private, and not under copyright. Therefore, as we are using the dataset for academic purposes, this dataset is acceptable for this annotation project. 

From this larger dataset, we will run a simple random sample in order to source our 500 documents, which we will annotate. Afterwards, we will use this data to train a model to predict the difficulty level of a recipe.
