While the guidelines go through many qualities that indicate a higher or lower energy level, they don’t offer a clear explanation for what makes something a 1, 2, 3, 4 for each of the characteristics. For instance, for text length, what makes it a 1 short, 2 kind of short, 3 kind of long, and 4 long. Knowing this would then be able to more clearly differentiate between the overall energy ranking of 1, 2, 3, 4. For each characteristic there is a qualifier of “may” when describing whether this quality would lead to a higher or lower energy score. I believe there should be more clarification on what “may” means or it should be removed. If a long text does not necessarily lead to a higher energy score then this can be resolved in an example showing where it does lead to a higher score and where it doesn’t. Having this type of example would make the “may” redundant. Generally, the examples provided were pretty great, but they did not contain a label so it was hard to apply the examples to the annotations. Also, in the annotation guidelines instructions it said to include disagreements between annotators and how those annotations were resolved. This would be a great thing to include and would help with labeling those that are in between a 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4. Also, it was easy to fall into the trap of equating positive sentiment to high energy level and equating negative sentiment to low energy level. Making a clear and explicit distinction between sentiment analysis and energy levels would further clarify the purpose of your annotations, make your project more unique in the broader NLP context, and make your group look very well informed and versed in NLP.
